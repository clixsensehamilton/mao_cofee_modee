# Backend/API Implementation Guide for Phase 2

## Overview
This document outlines the backend and API tasks for Phase 2, focusing on enhanced AI, voice interaction, and playful content delivery.

## Step-by-Step Tasks
1. **Upgrade AI Models**
   - Integrate advanced models for mood and menu analysis.
   - Ensure models can provide nuanced coffee suggestions.
   - Expose endpoints for AI-driven suggestions.
2. **Fun Facts & Playful Commentary API**
   - Create an endpoint to serve fun facts and playful messages.
   - Ensure each suggestion includes a fun fact/commentary.
3. **Voice Interaction Backend**
   - Implement endpoints for processing voice input (speech-to-text).
   - Add support for voice output (text-to-speech) via API.
4. **Accessibility Enhancements**
   - Ensure all endpoints support both text and voice workflows.
   - Add error handling and clear feedback for accessibility.

## Priorities
1. AI model upgrade and suggestion endpoint
2. Fun facts/playful commentary API
3. Voice input/output endpoints
4. Accessibility and feedback improvements

## Acceptance Criteria
- AI endpoints return nuanced, context-aware suggestions.
- Fun facts/playful commentary are included in API responses.
- Voice input/output APIs are functional and reliable.
- All endpoints are accessible and provide clear feedback.
