# Shared Logic/Data Implementation Guide for Phase 2

## Overview
This document covers shared logic and data tasks for Phase 2, ensuring consistency and reusability across backend and frontend.

## Step-by-Step Tasks
1. **Shared Data Models**
   - Define/update models for mood, menu, suggestions, and fun facts.
   - Ensure models are used consistently in backend and frontend.
2. **Validation & Transformation Utilities**
   - Implement shared utilities for validating and transforming user input (text/voice).
   - Provide helpers for formatting suggestions and commentary.
3. **Voice Interaction Logic**
   - Share logic for handling voice input/output formats.
   - Ensure compatibility between backend and frontend voice features.
4. **Accessibility Data Structures**
   - Define shared structures for accessibility metadata (e.g., ARIA labels, alt text).

## Priorities
1. Shared data models
2. Validation/transformation utilities
3. Voice interaction logic
4. Accessibility structures

## Acceptance Criteria
- Data models are consistent and reused across codebase.
- Shared utilities are available for input validation and formatting.
- Voice interaction logic is compatible across backend/frontend.
- Accessibility data is standardized and accessible.
